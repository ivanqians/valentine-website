            <p> To Ciel, From Ivan | Valentine's Day
                February, 2025
                
                My Dearest Ciel,
                
                I'm beyond grateful to have you in my life. Youâ€™ve shown me what it truly means to be loved and supported. You are absolutely gorgeous, and Iâ€™m honored to be the one you miss all day.
                
                Every moment with you feels like a dream. Your laughter is my favorite melody, and your smile brightens even my darkest days. You make my world infinitely better just by being in it.
                
                I love the way you understand me and make the simplest moments feel special. You are not just my Valentineâ€”you are my safe place, my joy, and my greatest love.
                
                I promise to always cherish you, stand by your side, and remind you every day how much you mean to me.
                
                Happy Valentineâ€™s Day, my love. I canâ€™t wait to make more beautiful memories with you.
                
                With all my love,
                Ivan
